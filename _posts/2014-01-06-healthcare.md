# Affordable Health Care for All

America has the best doctors, hospitals, and medical care in the world, yet quality care is often too expensive and inaccessible for too many people. We need to do more to improve our healthcare system by focusing on quality and access while lowering costs. Everyone should have afforadable access to quality healthcare.

- Protect important reforms like banning rate hikes that charge women more, and allow insurance companies to deny coverage for pre-existing conditions
- Increase competition in the healthcare marketplace by offering a voluntary medicare buy-in
- Allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, which would save taxpayers more than $230 billion over the next 10 years
